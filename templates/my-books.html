    <h2>Yu-Kai’s 1st Book – Actionable Gamification</h2>
    <div class="book-description">
        <p>After 20+ years of Gamification practice and research, after consulting for clients such as Google, Accenture, and Tesla, I decided it was time to share my knowledge and expertise with everyone around the world.</p>
        <p>To share my knowledge, I decided to write and publish a book about Gamification. But not just any book—my goal was to write the definitive book about “Gamification” that empowered a reader to immediately take action on their personal and professional lives.</p>
        <p>I’ll admit: I was nervous when I published the book, but today, I am immensely proud and humbled by the positive impact that my book has created.</p>
