                    After 20+ years of <a href="#" class="highlight-link">Gamification</a> practice and research, after consulting for clients such as Google, Accenture, and Tesla, I decided it was time to share my knowledge and expertise with everyone around the world.

                <p class="book-paragraph">
                    To share my knowledge, I decided to write and publish a book about Gamification. But not just any book: my goal was to write the definitive book about "Gamification" that empowered a reader to immediately take action on their personal and professional lives.

                <p class="book-paragraph">
                    I'll admit I was nervous when I published the book, but today, I am immensely proud and humbled by the positive impact that my book has created.

                I've been following Yu-kai's work on gamification for years and have enjoyed his deep insights and actionable recommendations. <span class="testimonial-highlight">Octalysis</span> is a powerful and pragmatic framework to understand human nature and positive motivations that encourage people to do their best work. It should be required reading for anyone building, managing, or collaborating with a team, community, or ecosystem.
